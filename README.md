# Text-de-shuffling
This is a natural language processing project on using transformers to rearrange incoherent into sentences to meaningful sentences . It is an exercise in text generation

Examples :

we have a dataset of texts(that are just jumbled incoherent sentences) and we would use an encoder-decoder model to learn a model between both sequences and reconstruct these sentences . 

This is an educative notebook to explore just how powerful transformers are and how they can be used . 

This notebook is still undergoing alot of changes for now as this project is not finished .
